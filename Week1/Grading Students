Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
Any  less than  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round  up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

def gradingStudents(grades):
    # Write your code here
    input = []
    for grade in grades:
        if grade >= 38:
            condition=grade%5
            if condition>=3:
                grade = grade + (5-condition)
            input.append(grade)
        else:
            input.append(grade)
    
    return input
